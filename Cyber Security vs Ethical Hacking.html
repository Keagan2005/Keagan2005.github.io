        <h1>Cyber Security vs Ethical Hacking</h1>
        <p>Cyber Security is a vast subject that includes a lot of network and information security mechanisms, such as data security, digital forensics, Ethical Hacking, and much more. Therefore, we can say that Ethical Hacking is a subpart of Cyber Security.</p>
        <p>Ethical Hacking is performed by ‘white-hat hackers’ whose work of hacking the system is the same as that of ‘black-hat’ hackers, but the intention is different. In the case of ethical hacking, the hacker hacks to protect the system.</p>
        <p>Cyber Security experts, on the other hand, don’t have to hack into the system. Their job is to protect the system by taking all possible protective measures.</p>
        <p>In the simplest of terms, Ethical Hackers make use of offensive security measures, and Cyber Security experts use defensive security measures.</p>
        <p>Let’s take an example here. Suppose, you have launched an application like Uber, and your app is generating and storing a lot of customer data per day. These records can be used by any malicious hacker for performing dubious acts, including generating huge amounts of false requests, accessing users’ account details who pay online, and many more.</p>
        <p>Here, the Cyber Security expert will try to defend the application by taking appropriate protective measures, or moreover, he/she will just inform the owner about the attack.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, an Ethical Hacker will try to attack the application with permission and will inform you about how he could hack the system, and then, he may also provide a solution for the issue.</p>
        <p>Ethical Hacking is like you are intentionally trying to hack into a system just to test how the system would respond to such malicious activities.</p>
